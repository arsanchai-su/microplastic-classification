# microplastic-classification
## Classification model 

This github is contain model after train of paper  `Characterization and Classification of Microplastic in Wastewater Treatment Plants using Convolutional Neural Networks and Transfer-Learning Approach` . 
<br />
<br />

Using model for inferance 
```
model = torch.load('efficientnet_microplastic)
```
